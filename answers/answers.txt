# My answer for the strongest trainer in the database is Supertrainer♀ Garvon, who achieved this ranking with her powerful Slaking.
# She has been scored as the strongest player by my metric that I calculated below, which is essentially looking for the pokemon that
# has the highest overall stats (attack + defense + sp.atk + sp.def + maxhp + speed). Slaking's total score by this metric topped the charts
# at a whopping 1048. Notably, this pokemon ties in score with 3 other pokemon in the database, so technically the following trainers also
# scored equally as high on the trainer leaderboard: Cooltrainer♀ Rask, Myth Trainer Infin, and Myth Trainer Inity. Interestingly enough,
# each of these trainers strongest pokemon were also Slaking.
